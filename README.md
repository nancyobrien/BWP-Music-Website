# BWP Music Usage

This site downloads and processes usage data from Planning Center Online (PCO) for Bethel Church's worship teams.  Requiring multiple API calls to retrieve JSON data to construct the data required to show what songs where play on what date, and how many times each song has been played, who led the song and in what key.  This site allows songs to be filtered by name, frequency of performance, and position in set list. Data for multiple venues are collected. Data can also be exported to an Excel spreadsheet for auditing purposes.

### Why?
Selecting music for service each week is made more convienient by allowing them to see what songs have been performed recently and in which slots. Data can be exported to fulfill auditing and record keeping requirements of music licensing services.
